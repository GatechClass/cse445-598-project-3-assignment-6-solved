<ul>
<li>In this question, you will develop and deploy the elective services and their TryIt pages. You must also deploy the required services developed in Assignment 5.</li>
</ul>
3.1 <strong>Elective Services</strong>: You must develop at least two elective services (or service operations). The elective services must be related to the application defined in question 1. At least one service must be converted to the <u>RESTful service</u>. For the rest of the services, you can choose to develop WSDL services or RESTful services. For developing RESTful service, please follow Lecture Slides L10 or

textbook section 7.3.3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>[25 points for 3.1]</strong>

The difficulty level of the elective services (operations) that you developed will be rated by the instructor and the teaching assistant into one of the three difficulty levels:

<ul>
<li>Easy: The method (operation) in this service implements a simple math function and can be done using less than 50 lines of code, for example, Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature conversion. [5 points each]</li>
<li>Moderate: There are algorithmic issues to address and the code for each method will be at least 50 lines, for example, encryption/decryption service, efficient sorting, and equation system solving. If a service operation can be done in less than 50 lines, but you use more than 50 lines, it will be counted</li>
</ul>
as an easy service.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10 points each]

<ul>
<li>Challenging: Services that will use states, such as creating a simulated (synthetic) banking service that allows users to sign up, create an account, deposit fund, spend fund, etc.; or services that make use of multiple available services (operations) or APIs provided by other providers, such as Microsoft services (e.g., Bing map service), Google code’s APIs, Amazon’s services, or the ASU services. These services and APIs may or may not have WSDL interface. Your services must provide WSDL interfaces. The data received from other services should be processed and combined before returning to the clients. The given required services are examples of challenging services: If you choose to implement these services, they count as challenging services. Database is not allowed in this assignment. If you need to store states, you can either a text file (See Chapter 3 L12 Slides) or an</li>
</ul>
XML file (Read Text Chapter 4 and also Chapter 5, Section 5.4). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [15 each]

To obtain the full points in question 3.1, you need to develop at least two services and at most four services. It implies that you cannot write five easy services in this question. If you write easy services only, the maximum points you can obtain in this question is 20. On the other hand, you can obtain 25 points at most, even if you develop more services and more difficult services than required. From the format point of view, you can either define these services methods in one big service, or define them as separate services. Each service and methods must be commented in detail, including the functionality, parameters, types, and the return value type.

<h4>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp; Development of TryIt Pages for Elective Services &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [5 points for 3.2]</h4>
You must develop TryIt test page for elective services. The requirement is the same as defined in question 2.2, but all the URLs must be based on the server URLs because the services have been deployed to the server. You must also have the URL of the Main page (See next question) linked to the test pages, so that one can return to the main page from the TryIt page.

<h4>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Deployment of Required Services, Elective Services, and TryIt pages &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [5 points for 3.3]</h4>
All the services (required and elective) and their TryIt pages must be deployed into WebStrar server. You must deploy the services first. Before deploying the TryIt pages, you must change all the service references from localhost addresses to the server addresses, so that the services can be tested from the server.

<ul>
<li>The main page must be an html page. The main page must be named index.html, so that the page can be accessed through the link<a href="http://webstrarx.fulton.asu.edu/index.html">: </a><u><a href="http://webstrarx.fulton.asu.edu/index.html">http://webstrar</a></u><u><a href="http://webstrarx.fulton.asu.edu/index.html">X</a></u><u><a href="http://webstrarx.fulton.asu.edu/index.html">.fulton.asu.edu/index.html</a></u><a href="http://webstrarx.fulton.asu.edu/index.html">,</a> where X is your site number. The main page must contain the following contents:</li>
</ul>
4.1 Service directory (a table) listing the services and links to the test pages (TryIt pages) and services. The schema and a list of example services are shown in the table below, which is similar to the table in the requirement document, except that the TryIt pages must be linked into the page.&nbsp; [8]

</table>
This page must also be submitted into Canvas. Make sure that you put the deployment URL in the first row of the page, so that the TA can test your services and TryIt page through reading this table!

You must submit a single zip file into Canvas. The zip file must contain all the <strong>elective services</strong> and their <strong>TryIt pages</strong> developed in assignment.

&nbsp;

4.3 Deploy the table in html into WebStrar server, in the root directory outside the pre-created directories, so that the page can be accessed using the address: [7 points]&nbsp; <u><a href="http://webstrarx.fulton.asu.edu/index.html">http://webstrar</a></u><u><a href="http://webstrarx.fulton.asu.edu/index.html">X</a></u><u><a href="http://webstrarx.fulton.asu.edu/index.html">.fulton.asu.edu/index.html</a></u> (change X to you site number)

The table and all the services (required and electives) must be deployed into the WebStrar server.

&nbsp;

<h1>Submission Requirement</h1>
All submissions must be electronically submitted to the assignment folder where you downloaded the assignment paper. The entire solution with all the files must be zipped into a single file.

If you have saved a project/Website in a different folder, you can copy the folder containing the project/Website to the directory where the other projects are saved. Then go into Visual Studio and delete the project/website that was in a different place. Then right click the solution in Visual Studio and add existing project/website, browse to the new location and select the project/website to link the moved project/website into the solution.
